	abstract = {This work presents two software components aimed to relieve the costs of accessing high-performance parallel computing resources within a Python programming environment: MPI for Python and PETSc for Python. MPI for Python is a general-purpose Python package that provides bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard using any back-end MPI implementation. Its facilities allow parallel Python programs to easily exploit multiple processors using the message passing paradigm. PETSc for Python provides access to the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) libraries. Its facilities allow sequential and parallel Python applications to exploit state of the art algorithms and data structures readily available in PETSc for the solution of large-scale problems in science and engineering. MPI for Python and PETSc for Python are fully integrated to PETSc-FEM, an MPI and PETSc based parallel, multiphysics, finite elements code developed at CIMEC laboratory. This software infrastructure supports research activities related to simulation of fluid flows with applications ranging from the design of microfluidic devices for biochemical analysis to modeling of large-scale stream/aquifer interactions.},

	abstract = {Based on a parallel scalable library for Coulomb interactions in particle systems, a comparison between the fast multipole method (FMM), multigrid-based methods, fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based methods, and a Maxwell solver is provided for the case of three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. These methods are directly compared with respect to complexity, scalability, performance, and accuracy. To ensure comparable conditions for all methods and to cover typical applications, we tested all methods on the same set of computers using identical benchmark systems. Our findings suggest that, depending on system size and desired accuracy, the FMM- and FFT-based methods are most efficient in performance and stability.},

In this article we investigate three algorithms for the FFT-accelerated Ewald sum, which attracted a widespread attention, namely, the so-called particle-particle-particle-mesh (P3M), particle mesh Ewald (PME) and smooth PME method. We present a unified view of the underlying techniques and the various ingredients which comprise those routines. Additionally, we offer detailed accuracy measurements, which shed some light on the influence of several tuning parameters and also show that the existing methods -- although similar in spirit -- exhibit remarkable differences in accuracy. We propose combinations of the individual components, mostly relying on the P3M approach, which we regard as most flexible.},

	abstract = {We have modiﬁed the conventional cell-linked list method to reduce the number of unnecessary internuclear distance calculations in molecular simulations of systems containing many particles. In the conventional method, the simulation space is partitioned into cells with edge lengths no less than the cutoff distance of the interaction potential (rcut). The atoms are assigned to cells according to their spatial positions, and all internuclear distances for atoms within a cell and atoms in the same and nearest neighbor cells are evaluated. While this method ensures that the internuclear separations between all atom pairs within rcut are calculated, it allows for unnecessary internuclear distance calculations between pairs that are within the volume encompassing the neighbor cells, but that are separated by more than rcut. The modiﬁed method presented here allows for reductions in the cell sizes and the number of atoms within the volume encompassing the neighbor cells. These reductions decrease the number of atoms that are outside of the interaction range and the number of unnecessary internuclear distance calculations while ensuring that all internuclear distances within the cutoff range are evaluated. We present algorithms to determine the volume with the minimum number of neighbor cells as a function of cell size and the identities of the neighboring cells. We also evaluate the serial performance using the modiﬁed form as functions of cell size and particle density for comparison with the performance using the conventional cell-linked list method.
